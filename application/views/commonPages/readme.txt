IF YOU ARE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE PAGE RENDERING AS PER USER ROLES:

This folder keeps all common pages for different kinds of user roles.
You will not understand the system just viewing the files from here as these are separated 'page components'

Have a look at the different user folders (admin, staff or teamleader) to understand with which components these pages are formed.
